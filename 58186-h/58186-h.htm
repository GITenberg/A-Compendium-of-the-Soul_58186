<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Several sources out of which to draw information
and seek guidance as to Ibn Sînâ’s biography
and writings, and his systems of <span class="correction" title="In the original book: medecine">medicine</span>
and philosophy, are nowadays easily accessible
to nearly every one. Among such sources the following
are the best for Egyptian students:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ibn Abi Uçaybi´ah’s “Tabaqât-ul-Atib-ba,”
and Wuestenfeld’s “Arabische Aertzte.”</li>

<li>Ibn Khallikân’s “Wafâyât-ul-A´ayân.”</li>

<li>Brockelmann’s “Arabische Literatur.”</li>

<li>F. Mehren’s Series of Essays on Ibn
Sînâ in the Periodical “Muséon” from the
year 1882 and on.</li>

<li>Clément Huart’s Arabic Literature, either
in the French Original or in the English Translation.</li>

<li>Carra de Vaux’s “Les Grands Philosophes:
Avicenna,” Paris, Felix Alcan, 1900,
pp. vii et 302.</li>

<li>T. de Boer’s “History of Philosophy in
Islâm,” both in Dutch and in the English translation.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>The “Offering to the Prince in the Form
of a Compendium on the Soul,” of which the
present Pamphlet is my attempt at an English
Translation, is the least known throughout Egypt
and Syria of all Ibn Sînâ’s many and able literary
works: indeed I have failed, after repeated
and prolonged enquiry, to come across so much
as one, among my many Egyptian acquaintances,
that had even heard of it.</p>

<p>Doctor Samuel Landauer of the University
of Strassburg published both the Arabic text,
and his own concise German translation, of this
Research into the Faculties of the Soul, in volume
29 for the year 1875 of the Z.d.D.M.G.,
together with his critical notes and exhaustively
erudite confrontations of the original Arabic with
many Greek passages from Plato, Aristotle, Alexander
Aphrodisias, and others, that Ibn Sînâ had
access to, it would appear, second hand, i.e.
through translations. Doctor Landauer made use
also of a very rare Latin translation by Andreas
Alpagus, printed at Venice in 1546; and of the
Cassel second edition of Jehuda Hallévy’s religious
Dialogue entitled Khusari, which is in rabbinical
Hebrew, and on pages 385 to 400 of which
the views of “philosophers” on the Soul are set
forth, Doctor Landauer having discovered to his
agreeable surprise that those 15 pages are simply
a word for word excerpt from this Research by
Ibn Sînâ. For the Arabic text itself, he had at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[Pg 9]</span>
his command only two manuscript copies, the one,
preserved in the Library at Leyden, being very
faulty; and the other, in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana
at Milan, being far more accurate and
correct.</p>

<p>This text was reprinted talis qualis, but with
omission of every kind of note, in 1884 at Beirût,
Syria, by Khalîl Sarkîs: this reprint is very hard
to find.</p>

<p>James Middleton MacDonald, M.A., made
a studiedly literal English translation or rather
a construe of it in 1884, of which he got a small
number printed in pamphlet form at Beirût, and
by Khalîl Sarkîs also: this English Version too
is very rare, and almost unknown.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My present English rendering of this Essay
by Avicena on the Powers of the Soul has been
made directly and finally from the Arabic Original
as given in the Landauer Text, with constant
consultation however of both the Landauer German
translation and the MacDonald English
construe: it has been made not for European
scholars and Arabists but solely for pupil students
in Egypt, which circumstance called in a great
measure for the use of two or more nearly synonymous
words where the Arabic original often
has but one only. Indeed I am not ashamed to
say further that in some places I have failed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span>
follow the drift and understand the purport of
Ibn Sînâ’s argument; so that in such passages I
am only too conscious of how far my rendering
may perhaps have wandered from the right and
true sense. But the author himself declares that
psychology is one of the deepest and darkest of
studies; and he relates of himself in his autobiography
that he had read one of Aristotle’s writings
forty times over, until he had got it by heart,
and yet had failed to see the point. And he goes
on to tell of how it was that he one day stumbled
across and then read over al-Fârâbî’s “Maqâçid
Aristotle,” whereupon mental light dawned upon
him as to the purport of that writing.</p>

<p>Those for whom I have made it now know
why this my English version is often timid and
wavering, nay sometimes even wordy and hazy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The end of the next year’s session will in
all likelihood bring with it the cessation of my
connection with the Khedivial School of Law.
More than this: I am getting well on in life, so
that this translation will most likely be the last
serious work that I shall ever perform in the
service of Young Egypt. Such reflections awaken
in my inmost soul all sorts of feelings and thoughts
about the shortness and fleetingness of this
earthly life, the happiness of childhood and youth,
the darkness of the grave, and the utter despair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span>
that will surely engulf the soul at the last hours,
unless&mdash;mark my words&mdash;unless the strong
arm of our Heavenly Father lay hold upon this
soul that is now within me, and take it off and
up, to be joined unto the millions of souls of
all, all those who have gone before, whither too
shall follow so many, many other millions; in a
word, unless GOD have mercy upon me, even as
He has had mercy upon my forefathers and mothers
since many generations. This hope in His
mercy and grace is my ever-strengthening prop
and stay, the older and feebler I get. Nor will
any of those for whom I write these lines ever
find a stronger or a better. And the time will
very soon come when each and every one of them,
however long may be his life here below, will
surely need it, to save him from sinking into
the black nothingness of doubt, indifference, and
despair.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>In the Name of GOD, the Merciful, the Compassionate:
May GOD bless our Lord Muhammad
and his Kinsfolk, and give them peace. O my
God facilitate [this undertaking]; and make [it]
end in good, O Thou Bounteous Being!</p>

<p>Abu-´Aly, Ibn Sînâ, the chief elder, learnèd
and erudite leader, the precise and accurate
researcher, Truth’s plea against mankind, the
physician of physicians, the philosopher of Islâm,
may the Most High GOD have mercy <span class="correction" title="In the original book: upom">upon</span> him,
saith:&mdash;</p>

<p>The best of beginnings is that which is
adorned with praise to the Giver of strength for
praising Him; and for invoking blessing and peace
upon our Lord Muhammad, His prophet and servant,
and upon his good and pure offspring after
him. And after this beginning, he saith further:&mdash;</p>

<p>Had not custom given leave to the small and
low to reach up to the great and high, it would
be most difficult for them ever to tread those
paths in going over which they need to lay hold
of their upholding arm<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and seek the help of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
their superior strength; to attain to a position in
their service, and join themselves to their social
circle; to pride themselves on having become
connected with them, and openly declare their
reliance upon them. Nay, the very bond which
joins the common man to the man of élite would
be severed, and the reliance of the flock upon its
shepherd would cease; the frail would no longer
become powerful through the strength of the
mighty, nor the low-born rise through the protection
and countenance of the high-born; the
foolish would not be able to correct his folly and
ignorance by intercourse with the prudent and
wise; nor the wise draw nigh to the ignorant
and foolish.</p>

<p>And whereas I find that custom has trod
along this highroad, and prescribed this usage,
I avail myself of such a precedent and excuse to
warrant my reaching up and aspiring to the
Prince, GOD give him long life, with an offering
[an acceptable present]; and I have given prevalence
to the thought that my choice ought to fall
upon an object which will at once be most acceptable
to him, and best calculated to attain my
aim of ingratiating myself into his favor; and
this, after coming to the certain conclusion that
the chief virtues are two, namely 1. Love of
wisdom as to the Articles of Faith, (i.e., Love
of Philosophy in theoretical principles); and
2. Choice of the most honest of deeds as to in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[Pg 15]</span>tention
(i.e., the preference of pure purposes in
practical life).</p>

<p>And in this connection I find the Prince,
God prolong his days, to have given to his intrinsically
worthy character so much of the polish
and lustre imparted by wisdom that he far outstrips
his rivals among the princes, and overtops all
such as are of his kind. And hence I clearly
perceive that of all presents the one he will
appreciate most is such as conduces to the most
precious of the virtues, to wit wisdom. I had,
however, so far profitted from a careful perusal
of the books of the learnèd as to find their
researches into the spiritual faculties among the
most abstruse and refractory against the mind’s
grasping what they mean, and the most bewildering,
obscure and misleading as to their results.
And yet I have seen it reported about a number
of wise men (philosophers) and pious<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> saints
that they agree in this dictum (motto), viz:
“Whoso Knoweth himself, Knoweth his Lord”;
and I have also heard the Chief of the Philosophers
say, in agreement with their saying: “Whoso
faileth to Know himself, is still more likely (apt)
to fail of Knowing his Creator”; and “How shall
he, who is trusted as a reliable authority in a
science, be deemed to have any views at all,
when he is ignorant of himself?” I see further
the Book of the Most High GOD pointing to the
measure of truth of this, where He says, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span>
mentioning the distance separating the Erring
from His mercy: Surah 59, al-Hashr, v. 19: “they
forgot God, and He made them forget themselves”;
is not His making the forgetting of self to depend
upon forgetting Him done so as to awaken the
attention to His closely binding the remembrance
of Him with the remembrance of self, and the
knowledge of Him with the knowledge of self,
scilicet of one’s own soul? Furthermore, I have
read in the books of the ancients that the hard
task of going deeply into the knowledge of self
had been enjoined upon them by an oracle that
had descended upon them at one of the temples
of the gods, which says: “Know thyself, O man,
so shalt thou know thy Lord.” I have also read
that this saying was engraved in the façade of
the temple of Aesculapius, who is known among
them as one of the prophets, and whose most
famous miracle is that he was wont to heal the
sick by mere loud supplication; and so did all
priests who performed sacerdotal functions in his
temple. From him have philosophers got the
science of <span class="correction" title="In the original book: medecine">medicine</span>.</p>

<p>Thus I have thought fit to make for the
Prince<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> a book on the soul, in the form of a
compendium; and I ask the Most High God to
prolong his life, to keep intact from the evil eye
his frail and mortal body, to refresh through him
wisdom after its fading, to revive it after its
languishing, to renew its might through his might,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[Pg 17]</span>
and to give it length of days through length of
days to him, in order that by his prestige the
advantages accruing from the prestige of its kin
shall become all-embracing, and that the number
of the seekers after its fullness shall abound. Nor
shall I achieve this my ambition save through
God: He is my all-sufficient stay, and best helper.
I have arranged the Book in sections, ten in all:&mdash;</p>

stand in such need of his countenance as to
dedicate to him this booklet in the humble and
lengthy terms of apology which run through the
greater part of the Introduction? It is Doctor
S. Landauer’s opinion that, with this Essay, Ibn
Sînâ began his career as a writer. After he had
completed the sixteenth year of his age, he was
summoned to the bedside of the suffering Sâmânid
prince, Nûh ibn Mançûr, who resided at
Bukhâra (See Ibn Khallikân’s Biographies), and
succeeded in curing him. Then, followed a long
period during which Ibn Sînâ removed from the
Court of one Ruler to that of another, and was
successively engaged in the service of various
Petty Dynasties in Khurasân. If then this Essay
was his maiden production&mdash;as Doctor Landauer
assumes&mdash;the author was still quite young,
and stood in need of the patronage he so earnestly
implores. Furthermore there is a manuscript
in Leyden, marked Codex 958, and numbered
1968 in the Catalogue, which is a small
treatise on the soul by Ibn Sînâ, closing as
follows:
</p>
<p>
«I had produced a short essay on the exposition
of the knowledge of the soul, and what
is connected therewith, at the beginning of my
career forty years ago, after the purely philosophical
method of investigation. Whoso wishes
to know that method, let him peruse it, for it
is adapted to the seekers of research.»
</p>
<p>
The «40 years ago» fit exactly, if students one
assumes that the literary production referred to
is the one he dedicated to «the Prince.» Now,
the first prince he came in contact with was Nûh
ibn Mançûr (ruled from 366&ndash;387 H. = 976&ndash;997
A.D., the Eighth of the Sâmânid Dynasty).
Ibn Khallikân relates that Ibn Sînâ, at the age
of 16 years, had begun to have a great reputation
as a physician. Moreover the Latin translation
in Florence of this essay bears in express
words the dedication to Nûh. Result:

<h2><a name="SECTION_FIRST" id="SECTION_FIRST"></a>SECTION FIRST</h2>


<p class="chapter-head">To Establish the Existence of the Spiritual
Faculties, the Detailed Analysis of which
I have undertaken.</p>


<p>Whoso wishes to describe anything whatsoever
before proceeding to establish first its<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>reality
of existence, such a one is counted by the wise
among those who deviate from the broad beaten
track of perspicuous statement. It is incumbent
upon us, therefore, to first set to work to establish
the existence of the spiritual powers, before
starting to define each one of them singly,
and enlarge upon it.</p>

<p>And whereas the most peculiar characteristics
of spiritual properties are two&mdash;one of them
Setting in Motion (Impulsion), and the other
Perception&mdash;it is incumbent upon us to show
that to every moving body there is a<a name="FNanchor_A_7" id="FNanchor_A_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_7" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>moving
cause (ground, reason, motive, pretence). Then it
will become evident to us therefrom that bodies
moving in motions over and above the natural
motions&mdash;an example of natural motions is the
sinking of the heavy, and the rising of the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span>&mdash;have
moving<a name="FNanchor_B_8" id="FNanchor_B_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_8" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> causes, which we call souls
or spiritual powers; and that we further show
that any body, in so far as it shows signs (traces)
that it is perceptive, such perception by it cannot
be validly ascribed to its body, except because of
powers (faculties) in it that are capable of perception.</p>

<p>We now start by saying that not a shadow
of doubt or perplexity hampers the mind, as to
things, that some of them share some one thing
in common, and differ in an other; and that that
which is shared in common is other than that in
which they differ. The mind encounters all bodies
whatsoever as having this in common, viz. that
they are bodies; and afterwards it encounters
them as differing in that they move (in different
ways); otherwise there would be no such thing as
rest of a body, and not even such a thing as
motion of a body, except along a circle, seeing
that of motion in a straight line it is established
by its very form that it will not proceed save
from stoppings and to stoppings (resting-places
to resting-places). Hence it is evident that bodies
are not to be clothed with the attribute of motion
because they are bodies, but for reasons (causes)
above and beyond their corporeity, from which
causes their motions proceed, like the resulting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span>
of the footprint from the walker (or, just as the
effect proceeds from the agent).</p>

<p>So much having become clear to us, we say
that we find, among bodies generated from the
Four Elements,<a name="FNanchor_7_9" id="FNanchor_7_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_9" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> such as moves, not by constraint,
in two kinds of motion between which
there is more or less difference: The one kind
inherent in its element by reason of the supremacy
over it of the power of one of its constituents,
and thus decreeing its motion towards the position
in space naturally appointed for it, as for example
a man’s moving by the nature of the preponderating<a name="FNanchor_8_10" id="FNanchor_8_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_10" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
heavy element in his body downwards;
nor will this kind of the motions of bodies be
found to take place save in one direction and
with a constant tendency; The second kind of
motion going against the decree of its element,
which decree is either rest in the natural position
as soon as it reaches that position, as for example
a man’s moving his body along its natural home
which is the Earth’s surface; or else a moving
away from the natural position when already
separated from it, like a flying bird’s motion with
its heavy body high up through the sky. It has
thus been made manifest [to the reader] that the
two motions have two accounting causes, and
that they are quite different one from the other:
the one is called Natural, and the second called
Soul or Spiritual Faculty. Hence it is quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span>
sound, as to motion, to affirm the existence of
spiritual faculties.</p>

<p>Whereas, in respect of Perception, because
that bodies exist with this in common, viz. that
they are bodies, and with this in distinction,
viz. that they are repeatedly perceptive, it is
quite manifest by the first (preceding) process of
discrimination that perception will not ever differ
from bodies through difference of their substance,
but by certain powers or faculties borne within
those bodies. It therefore becomes quite clear by
this sort of exposition that spiritual faculties
have an existence: and this is what we wished
to demonstrate.</p>

<h2><a name="SECTION_SECOND" id="SECTION_SECOND"></a>SECTION SECOND</h2>


<p class="chapter-head">Of the Division of the Spiritual Faculties and
their Classification into Three Main Classes,
and the Definition of the Soul in a General
Way.</p>


<h3><a name="SUB-SECTION_2-A" id="SUB-SECTION_2-A"></a>SUB-SECTION A:</h3>

<p>It has been clearly shown by us in the foregoing
that of things there are some which have
one thing in common and differ in an other, in
that the one in common is other than the one
differed in. Then we found compound ensouled
bodies&mdash;I mean possessing souls&mdash;to have
agreed and differed in the properties both of
their impulsion and their perception. As to impulsion,
they agree and differ, in that one and
all of them has in common that they move in
quantity the motion of growth; and they differ,
in that one sett among them moves, together
with that growth, in local motions according to
the will; and one other sett among them does
not so move, such as plants. Likewise living
beings have in common that they are both sentient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[Pg 26]</span>
and perceptive, up to a certain sort of sensuous
perception; and then afterwards they differ in
that one sett among them perceives, together with
that sort of sensuous perception, by intellectual
perception; and one other sett among them does
not so perceive, such as the ass and the horse.
We further found the power of impulsion to be
more widely embracing than the power of perception,
in that we found plants to lack the latter
utterly. Hence we knew for certain that the faculty
in which the animal agrees with the plant
is more general than this perceptive faculty, and
than the impelling faculty which is in the animal;
and each one of them is more general than the
speaking (rational) faculty, which belongs to man.
Thus then, the spiritual faculties come forth (or
stand out) before us set and ranged, in respect
of the common and the peculiar, i.e., according
to the general and special<a name="FNanchor_C_11" id="FNanchor_C_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_11" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>, under three classes
or ranks:<a name="FNanchor_D_12" id="FNanchor_D_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_12" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>The first of which is known as the plant or
vegetable power, on account of the participation
therein of the animal and plant;</p>

<p>The second is known as the animal power;</p>

<p>The third, as the speaking power, or rational
faculty.</p>

<p>Therefore, the primary parts of the soul, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span>
contemplating it from the standpoint of its powers,
are three.</p>


<h3 title="SUB-SECTION B:"><a name="SUB-SECTION_2-B" id="SUB-SECTION_2-B"></a>SUB-SECTION B:<a name="FNanchor_E_13" id="FNanchor_E_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_13" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></h3>

<p>To treat now of the definition of the Soul at
large, I mean the universal, absolute, generic
soul. This will become apparent, according to the
tenets I hold, that among truths that are plainly
manifest one is that every one of all natural
bodies is compounded of “hyle” I mean matter,
and of form. As for hyle, one of its properties
is that through it a natural body is affected (or
acted upon) in its very self; seeing that the
sword, for instance, does not cut through its iron,
but through its sharpness, which is its form;
whereas it gets jagged owing to its iron, and
not owing to its form. Another of those properties
is that bodies do not differ through it,
I mean through the hyle; for earth does not differ
from water through its matter, but through its
form.<a name="FNanchor_9_14" id="FNanchor_9_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_14" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Still another property is that it&mdash;the
hyle or matter&mdash;does not afford (supply, furnish)
natural bodies their characteristics peculiarly belonging
to them, save potentially; since in man,
e.g., his humanity&mdash;his being man&mdash;is not
actually derived from the four elements, save
potentially.</p>

<p>As for the form, its peculiarity is 1.<sup>o</sup> that
through it bodies put forth their actions (or
perform their manifold deeds and workings);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>[Pg 28]</span>
since a sword does not cut through its iron, but
through, its sharpness; and 2.<sup>o</sup> that bodies differ
one from the other only through their genus or
kind, I mean the form, since earth does not
differ from water save through its form, whereas
in its matter it does not; and 3.<sup>o</sup> that natural
bodies get (derive, acquire) their being what they
in fact are from the form, since as to man, his
being a man (his humanity) is in fact through
his form, and not through his matter, which is
of the four elements.</p>

<p>Let us proceed a little further, and we shall
say that a live body is a natural compound body
that discriminates the non-living through its soul,
and not through its body; and that performs multifarious
animal works through its soul, and not
through its body; and is alive through its soul
and not through its body; and its soul is within
it. Now, what is within a thing, while this form
of its continues, is its form [or, this its form
being so and not otherwise, is etc.]. Thus then the
soul is a form; and forms are realized perfections
(enteléchia), since through them the features (identities,
characteristics) of things become perfect. The
soul, therefore is a perfection (realized identity). And
perfections (enteléchias) come under two divisions:
either the principles underlying the doings and
their effects, or the very doings and effects
themselves. The one of the two divisions is first,
and the other is second. The first is the principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span>
(or source and origin), and the second is the doing
and the effect (or trace). In this sense the soul
is a first perfection (or prime actuality); for it
is a principle (source), not an outcome of a
principle (source). And of perfections, there are
such as belong to bodies, and such as belong
to incorporeal substances. In this sense the soul
is a prime perfection attaching to a body. And
among bodies, there are such as are artificial, and
such as are natural. Now the soul is not a perfection
of an artificial body; hence it is a prime
perfection attaching to a natural body. Again,
among natural bodies there are such as perform
their multifarious workings through organs (tools,
instruments), and such as do not perform their
workings through organs (tools); as, for example
the simple bodies, and those acting through the
prevalence (constraint) of the simple forces. In
other words we may say, if we like, that among
natural bodies there are those whose design is,
among other things, that they produce of themselves
[whose task or business is to perform animal
acts voluntarily, of their own will,] manifold
animal actions; and there are those whose design
is, among other things, not so to produce. Hence
again, the soul is not a perfection attaching to
the two last divisions in both the foregoing manners
of statement. Therefore its full and finished
definition is to say that&mdash;</p>

<p>It is a prime perfection (consummation, rea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span>lization)
attaching to an organic natural body;
and, if we wish, to say further, a prime perfection
attaching to a natural body having a life potentially
(a first, perfection belonging to a natural
body which body may have life); that is to say,
a source of the manifold animal actions potentially
(it is the source and origin of the deeds done by
such beings as may be alive). Thus then we have
divided (described) the generic soul, and defined
it&mdash;which is what we had undertaken.</p>

<h2><a name="SECTION_THIRD" id="SECTION_THIRD"></a>SECTION THIRD</h2>


<p class="chapter-head">To Establish that not One of the Faculties of
the Soul Originates out of a Combination
(Blending) of the Elements, but on the contrary
Comes upon Them from Outside.</p>


<p>All the various things that are, however
composite they may be, and whatever form may
have come about in the compound, will be (a)
either inclining towards some one of the forms
of the simples, or else will not be so. And if
they be not so inclining, they will be (b) either
resulting from an aggregate (or mean) of the
forms of the simples, according to the degree of
disproportion and deviation of the constituents
from equality, or else (c) they will not be assimilated
to any one of the simples, but there will
be made (generated, produced) a form exceeding
the requirement of the forms of the simples, both in
regard to the measure of its simplicity and in
regard to the measure of its complexity. An example
of the first division is the bitterish taste on compounding
aloe, which is overpoweringly bitter, and
honey, which is feebly sweet. An example of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span>
second division is the color grey, holding an
equal relationship to both of the extremes (contrasts)
blackness and whiteness, which results on compounding
a white and a black opposite. An example
of the third of the said divisions is the
seal’s stamp (imprint) remaining in the clay
(mortar, putty) which is composed of dry dust
and liquid water on their being mixed up together;
for it is known that the imprint remaining in
the putty is not in pursuance to the requirement
of the forms of the simples, neither whether they
be considered in respect of the resultant compound,
nor whether they be considered in respect of the
simple <span class="correction" title="In the original book: consituents">constituents</span> taken singly.</p>

<p>To recapitulate:&mdash;it is known that the first
division, if it be produced, from simples whose
forms are opposed (contrary) not through mechanical
mixture (commingling) but through<a name="FNanchor_10_15" id="FNanchor_10_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_15" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> blending
(<span class="correction" title="In the original book: aloy">alloy</span>, amalgam)&mdash;it is clear I say in such
cases that the overpowered contraries will no
longer have an existence of their own, nor an
existence of the effects peculiar to them, because
of the impossibility of two contraries working
together in one and the same carrier (medium),
but the utmost effects they can exert will be to
introduce a decrease in the strength of the overpowering
constituent, and nothing more; and it
is known that the second division, in what proportions
soever it be found, imposes reciprocity
and equality both passive and active, that is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span>
say the manifold workings that the forms of the
simples necessarily exert and the corresponding
effects that these forms suffer mutually one from
the other must of necessity be reciprocal, and in
the ratio of their respective proportions and
strengths; and lastly, it is known that the third
division, if it comes about, will not have resulted
from the intrinsic (very) self of the compound,
since it in no way at all belongs to it, neither
in consideration of its simple nor of its composite
form. Hence it is gained (got, acquired) from
without.</p>

<p>It is now necessary, since we have prefixed
these premisses, that we go deeper into our
pursuit, so we say:&mdash;</p>

<p>That the soul has only come forth [for us
through the foregoing contemplations] in compound
bodies whose forms are opposed and in none
others; nor will its manifestation in them be
devoid (divested) of one of the three divisions;
but it is not of the first division; else it is heat
or coldness, dryness or moisture (dampness), in
any of which soever a decrease has more or less
come about; and how shall any one of these
powers be fit to put forth from itself multifarious
psychical deeds, given the fact of the decrease
(defect) occasioned in the very composition, and
given also what it would have expended in that
decrease out of its strength? nay, how shall any
one of these powers cause motion save towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span>
one direction alone? and wherefore has it become
necessary to effect mutual exclusion (displacement)
among psychical movements so that their mutual
exclusion (displacement) shall engender a dullness
(or weariness), since in the effect (influence) of
one identical thing there does not arise exclusion;
nor is it of the second division, since the existence
of the second division is an impossibility, and
this because the elements, however much they
may be compounded, under (proportionate) equality
of the powers, this necessitates in them the
stoppage (cessation) of all the effects attaching
to each one of the two, and thus if the compound
were left alone (abandoned to itself) it would
never have to move, neither upwards&mdash;else the
heat is the overpowerer and the cold is the one
overpowered&mdash;nor downwards&mdash;else the cold
is the overpowerer and the heat is the one
overpowered&mdash;nay nor even would it remain
at rest in one of the four spots of space (wherein
dwell all the four elements)&mdash;else Nature which
attracts towards itself is the overpowerer therein&mdash;whereas
it has been asserted that all of them
are equal both to overpower and to be overpowered,
and this is a contradiction: Therefore this
body (such a body) is neither still nor moving,&mdash;whereas
every body which is surrounded by
another body is either still or moving,&mdash;and
this too is a contradiction; and what leads to
contradiction is itself a contradiction; so then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span>
our assertion that the elements may possibly be
compounded under equality of the powers is a
contradiction, and hence its opposite, to wit our
saying that such is impossible, is true [reduction
ad absurdam]. Wherefore the coming forth of the
soul, i.e., its combination with body, occurs only
after the method of the third division; and it
has been already said that what is after the

<p class="chapter-head">Specification of the Vegetable (Plant) Powers,
and Mention of the Need there is for Each
One of Them.</p>


<p>Souled bodies, I mean having souls, if considered
from the side of their vegetable powers,
are found to have in common the getting of nourishment,
and to differ in growth and generation
(reproduction of offspring); since, among nourishment-taking
beings, there are such as do not
grow, for example a living individual that has
reached full growth and the period of stand still,
or that has declined therefrom through withering.
Yet every growing thing gets nourishment. Again,
among nutriment-taking beings there are such as
do not propagate, as seeds that are not yet
harvest-ripe, and an animal that has not yet
reached puberty. Nevertheless, every propagating
thing has inevitably passed through a preceding
stage of nutrition; nor will the state (stage) of
propagating ever be deprived of nutrition. Further,
we find them, beside having the getting of
nourishment in common, to have growth also in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[Pg 38]</span>
common, but to differ in the propagation (of
offspring) since there are, among growing things,
such as do not beget, as an animal not yet arrived
at puberty, and the worm.<a name="FNanchor_11_16" id="FNanchor_11_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_16" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Nevertheless
every begetter has already passed through a
period of growth; nor will the state (stage) of
begetting be deprived of the power of giving
growth [to the young that are being produced].
Hence the vegetable powers are three:</p>

<p>1. the nutritive; 2. the growth promoting;
and 3. the propagating. Of these the nutritive is
as the starting-point; the propagating as the aim
and end; and the growth-promoting as the means
binding the end to the starting-place. Indeed the
souled body stands in absolute need of these three
powers for the following reasons: Whereas the
Divine Command came down upon Nature enjoining
(imposing) upon her the task of forming a
compound living being out of the four elements
after such wise fashion as they called for in it;
and whereas Nature of herself is unable to originate
a souled body at one stroke, but can do
so only by promoting its growth little by little;<a name="FNanchor_F_17" id="FNanchor_F_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_17" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>
and whereas an individual that is put together
after the manner of animal composition is susceptible
of being again decomposed and melting
away by the natures of its constituents; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[Pg 39]</span>
whereas a thing composed of opposites will not
keep up so protracted a duration and last so
long a time as is expected of it&mdash;therefore
Nature is in want of a power by which she can
fabricate a living body by promotion of growth;
so she has been supplied by Divine Providence
with the growth-giving power; and is in want
of a power whereby she can preserve the souled
body at an even standard<a name="FNanchor_G_18" id="FNanchor_G_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_18" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> over against the
waste which it undergoes in making up for what
disintegration wears away from it; so she has
been succoured by Divine Providence with the
nutritive power; and is in want of a power that
shall mould, out of the living natural body, a
piece that she shall dwell in, in order that if
corruption permeate the body it shall have sought
for itself a successor as a substitute, whereby to
arrive at the preservation of species; so she has
been helped by the Divine Providence with the
propagating (generating) power.</p>

<p>And we ought, in this connection, to bear
in mind as a certain and true fact that the
growth-giving power, although it has been found,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[Pg 40]</span>
from the standpoint that we have mentioned, to
be following close upon the nutritive, and the
propagating (generating) to be following close
upon the growth-imparting (promoting), yet the
precedence of the part played by each one of
the three, in their undertaking the task of creating
the living body and preserving it through their
special and peculiar workings, is the other way
about; for the first to enthrall the material
predisposed to receive life is the generating
(procreating, propagating) power, since this power
clothes the material at first with the form (prototype)
of that which is intended to be realized
through the ministry (service) of the growth-promoting
and nutritive powers; and as soon as it
has achieved in that material a perfect form it
delivers over the sway to the growth-promoting
power, which assumes it through the ministry
(service) of the nutritive power, and imparts to
the material&mdash;all the time keeping up the form
of the material within the due proportions of
the [three] dimensions [length, breadth and thickness]&mdash;a
motion (activity) of growth towards
the end striven after by it, the growth-promoting
power aforesaid. Then this latter stops; and the
nutritive power enthralls the material. Again,
the generating (propagating) power is the one
served, not the servant; and in comparison with
it, the nutritive power is the servant, not the one
served. Thus too the growth-promoting power is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[Pg 41]</span>
served in one sense, and serving in an other sense.
And the nutritive power, although it does not
exist as the one served in the spiritual powers,
yet it does sometimes employ the four forces of
Nature&mdash;to wit, the attracting, the holding, the
digesting, and the excreting (repelling). And, even
as that which is striven after in the process of
form-making is solely the bringing about of the
[due] form in matter in the shape (kind, design)
proposed, and not at all the bringing about of
growth or of nutrition,&mdash;only that there is need
for the two latter for the sake of realizing the
desired form, and not the converse&mdash;so also
the final aim in the [several] powers is the procreating
(propagating) power, to the exclusion of
the growth-promoting and of the nutritive. Wherefore,
the procreating power is given precedence
for a teliological reason.</p>

<p>And through God is fitness to be achieved.</p>

<h2><a name="SECTION_FIFTH" id="SECTION_FIFTH"></a>SECTION FIFTH</h2>


<p class="chapter-head">Specification of the Animal Powers, and Mention
of the Need there is for Each One of Them.</p>


<p>I affirm that every animal is sentient, and
hence it moves itself at will, in some sort of
motion; and that every animal moves itself in
some sort of motion at will, and hence it is
sentient; since sensation in what does not move
itself at will is wasted and useless, and the lack
of it in what does move itself at will is harmful;
whereas Nature, owing to that much of Divine
Providence as has been joined to her, gives nothing
whatever that is either wasted or harmful,
nor witholds either the necessary or the useful.
Perhaps some one may speak out here and object
to us that shellfish are of such as feel (are
sentient) and yet do not move themselves at will.
This objection, however, will speedily vanish on
experiment; for shellfish, although they do not
move themselves from their places in a sort of
organic (mechanical) locomotion at will, yet they
do more or less shrink themselves up and spread
out inside of their shells, as I have witnessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[Pg 44]</span>
with mine own eyes on having tried the experiment
more than once, in that I turned the shell over
onto its back, so that its position for drawing
nourishment became separated from the ground;
whereupon it ceased not to struggle until it had
again stood in a position that made it easy for
it to draw in nourishment from the muddy bottom.</p>

<p>And now that this has become surely certain
for us, we shall further say:</p>

<p>That whereas Divine Wisdom has decreed
that an animal moving itself at will shall be
composed of the four elements, and as such animal
would not be secure against the evils of mishaps
in its successive change of places during locomotion,
it has been fitted out with the touching
power (sense of touch), so as to flee through it
from unfit places, and seek those that are fit.
And whereas any such animal’s constitution (make-up)
cannot get on without the getting of nourishment;
and as its gaining its food is a sort of
free will effort; and as some articles of food suit
it, and others do not,&mdash;it has been fitted out
with the tasting power (sense of taste). These two
powers (senses) are both useful and necessary in
life: the rest are useful, not necessary.</p>

<p>Next after the Tasting, in degree of utmost
need for it, comes the Smelling Sense, since
odors will point the animal towards suitable
articles of nourishment, with a strong indication;
nor will the animal be at all able to get on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[Pg 45]</span>
without nourishment, neither will its nourishment
be got by it save through self-help. So Divine
Providence has deemed fit to impart the smelling
power unto most animals. The next after the
smelling power in usefulness is the Seeing Power:
the How and Why of its usefulness, as to the
animal, which moves itself at will, is that whereas
its betaking itself to certain spots, such as fire-hearths,
and away from certain spots, such as
mountain peaks and seashores, is such as will
lead to its hurt, therefore Divine Providence has
deemed fit to impart the seeing power unto most
animals. The next after the seeing power in
usefulness is the Hearing Power. The How and
Why of its usefulness is that things harmful and
things useful may often be recognized as such,
through it, by the peculiarity of their sounds
and voices; so Divine Providence has deemed fit
to impart the hearing power unto most animals.
Moreover, the use made of this power by the
rational (speaking) species of the animal genus
almost surpasses the three [&mdash;is of all three
nearly the highest]. This then is an outline of
the How and Why of the uses of the Five Outward
(External) Senses.</p>

<p>And whereas trustworthy arrival at a knowledge
of the mutually suitable and the mutually
repellent will come about only through test (experiment,
experience), Divine Providence has deemed
fit to impart the peculiar participating property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[Pg 46]</span>
(or sense)&mdash;I mean the picturing power&mdash;unto
living beings (animals), in order that they shall
through it preserve the forms of things perceived
by the senses; and to impart the remembering
preserving power, in order that they shall through
it preserve the meanings (significances) conceived
out of things perceived by the senses; and to
impart the imaginative power in order that they
shall through it fit up (restore) what shall be
wiped out from the memory by a sort of motion;
and to impart the conjecturing (surmising) power
in order that they shall through it fix upon the
sound (true) and the weak (false) of what the
imagination extracts, namely to fix upon the true
and false thereof with more or less presumption
of certainty, until they [the living beings] shall
review it in the mind.</p>

<p>As for the How and Why of need for the moving
power, it is that whereas the position of the animal
is not the same as the position of the plant in its
adaptation for attracting such foods as are useful
and pushing off such as are harmful and incompatible,
but on the contrary as this is brought
about for the animal through a sort of earning
by self-help, it needs a moving power for the
purpose of drawing to itself the useful and driving
away the harmful. Wherefore all the powers of
the animal are either perceiving or motion-promoting.
The motion-promoting is the yearning
(desiderative, longing, craving) power: it is either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[Pg 47]</span>
urging on to the search after a chosen object of
animal good, and then it is the lusting power;
or else it is urging on to the warding off of an
object of animal dislike, and then it is the hating
power (angry power).</p>

<p>The perceiving power too is either outward
(apparent), such as the five senses; or else inward
(internal, hidden), such as the picturing, the
imaginative, the conjecturing, and the remembering
power.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the motion-promoting power
does not cause to move save on a peremptory
bidding from the conjecturing, through the agency
(means) [or by the employment] of the imaginative.
Also, the motion-promoting power, in animals
other than the speaking (or rational) species, is
the aim and end; and this is so, because the
motion-causing power is not imparted unto them
in order that they shall through it direct aright
the workings of sensation and imagination so as
to adapt these workings to the attainment of
their own good, but on the contrary the power
of sensation and of imagination are imparted to
the non-speaking irrational animals solely in order
to direct aright through them the workings of
motion, and to adapt these workings to the good
of the animals. Whereas, the speaking rational
species of living beings is on the reverse wise;
because unto it was imparted the motion-causing
power wholly and solely in order that through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[Pg 48]</span>
this power it shall be fitted to set aright the
speaking self, i.e., the rational intelligent soul,
not the other way about.</p>

<p>Thus then, the motion-promoting power in
the irrational animal is, as it were, the prince
commander that is served; the five senses, the
spies that are sent forth; the perceptive power,
the post-master of the prince commander unto
whom the spies return; the imagining power,
the foot-messenger going to and fro between the
post<a name="FNanchor_H_19" id="FNanchor_H_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_19" class="fnanchor">[H]</a><a name="FNanchor_12_20" id="FNanchor_12_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_20" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and the post-master; the conjecturing
power, the prince’s adjutant minister; the remembering
power, the closet of state papers.</p>

<p>As for the starry firmament and plants, the
feeling power and the imagining power have not
been imparted unto them, even though each one
of them has a soul and though it has life: the
firmament has not these powers, because of its
loftiness; plants have them not, because of their
abasement in comparison to it.</p>

<h2><a name="SECTION_SIXTH" id="SECTION_SIXTH"></a>SECTION SIXTH</h2>


<p class="chapter-head">Treating in Detail of the Five Senses, and of
How they perceive.</p>


<p>As to the seeing power, philosophers have
differed on the question of How they perceive.
Thus one set among them asserts that they perceive
wholly and solely through a ray that shoots
out beyond the eye, and so encounters the sensible
objects that are seen. This is Plato’s way.<a name="FNanchor_13_21" id="FNanchor_13_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_21" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Others assert that the perceiving power itself
encounters the sensible objects that are seen, and
so perceives them. Still others say that visual
perception consists in this:&mdash;When the intervening
transparent body becomes effectively transparent
by light shining upon it, then an impression
of the outspread (flattened) individual of such
sensible objects as are seen is effected in the
cristalline<a name="FNanchor_14_22" id="FNanchor_14_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_22" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> lens of the eye, just such a pictorial
impression as is effected in looking-glasses (mirrors);
indeed the two effects are so similar that
were mirrors possessed of a seeing power they
would perceive the form imprinted in them. This
is Aristotle’s way; and it is the sound reliable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[Pg 52]</span>
opinion. That Plato’s view is false, is quite clear.
For, were it true that a ray goes out from the
seat of sight and encounters sensible objects, then
sight would be in no need of light, but would
on the contrary perceive in the dark, and would
rather illuminate the air on its exit into the
dark. Moreover such a ray will not fail of one of
two modes: either it will subsist throughout the
eye only, in which case Plato’s opinion that it
goes forth from the eye is wrong; or else it will
subsist throughout a body other than the material
of which the eye is composed; for it must inevitably
have a vehicle to carry it, seeing that a ray
is an accidental quality or mode, and furthermore
seeing that that body which is other than the eye
will not fail, in its turn, of being, either, <i>firstly</i>,
sent out from the eye, in which case it will follow
as a matter of course that the eye will not see
all that is beneath the clear blue of the sky,
since one body will not penetrate throughout the
whole of another body, unless forsooth it moves
the latter away and occupies its place; and even
should the disputer plead a vacuum, not only
does Plato deny the existence of a vacuum utterly,
but also if we accomodatingly yield this point
and admit the existence of a vacuum, yet for all
this the body that goes forth from the eye will
penetrate throughout the body of water, for example,
into such of <span class="correction" title="In the original book: its its">its</span> pores as are empty only, and
not into the whole of the water’s bulk; so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[Pg 53]</span>
even according to this opinion it will necessarily
so be that the eye will see only some places of
all that is under water;&mdash;or else, <i>secondly</i>, that
body which is other than the eye will not fail of
being an intervening body intermediate between
the seer and the seen, in which case the light<a name="FNanchor_I_23" id="FNanchor_I_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_23" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>
which comes forth from the eye will subsist
through it; nevertheless this opinion too is unsound,
for the reason that every thing whatsoever
is, in proximity to its source, so much the stronger,
and in this respect light has not its equal;
whence it follows as regards the object seen that,
however closely and nearly it approaches to the
eye, our perception will then be stronger; and
thus if we do away with the intermediary body,
the eye will still perceive the object felt by its
sense of sight, and thus the intermediary which
is the vehicle and carrier of light is no longer
needed, save accidentally (by chance); and then
too there is no need, in order to see, for an exit
of light: this too is a falsehood. Wherefore Plato’s
opinion is worthless.</p>

<p>As for such as hold that the perceiver of the
thing seen is the imaginative power itself through
the imprinting of the form (image) of the sensible
object upon it, these render the absent on the
same footing as the present, since in the imaginative
power there may exist the image of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[Pg 54]</span>
sensible object, notwithstanding the absence afterwards
of the object that had been so felt: at
which time however the living being so preserving
that image will not be qualified with sight but
with imagination and memory. Furthermore these
theorists (opiners) make a greater blunder still,
seeing that they render a thing of Nature’s make
and composition wholly idle, useless, and unneeded
in the operation of visual perception; inasmuch
as in their opinion the imaginative power itself
meets immediately sensible objects, and thus
spares Nature the task of adapting an instrument
(organ), to wit the complex eye.</p>

<p>Wherefore the sound theory is that the configurations
of things stand out in the transparent
ambient&mdash;if it be effectively transparent on
the shining of a luminant upon it&mdash;and hence
they do not appear but in a polished body capable
of receiving them, such as mirrors and the like;
and so too there is in the eye a crystalline lens
(or humor) into which the forms (pictures) of
things are imprinted, just as their impression
into mirrors; and in it, i.e., the lens or the eye,
has been fitted up the seeing power; so that, if
such forms are imprinted in it, it perceives them.
Moreover, the objects of perception belonging in
truth and deed to sight are the Colors.</p>

<p>As for the Hearing Power: it hears only
sound. And sound is a motion of air that the
ear feels on two hard smooth bodies coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[Pg 55]</span>
quickly close up one to the other, the escaping
of the air from between them, its striking the
ear, and its moving the air that is kept ready
within the instrument (organ) of hearing. Thus,
if this inside air move the instrument, and if
this instrument’s motion act upon the nerve of
hearing, the hearing power (sense, faculty) perceives
it in the measure of the strength or
weakness of that motion. Indeed hardness is a
<i>conditio sine qua non</i>; for, in the case of two
soft bodies, the air will not escape from them,
but will dissipate itself throughout their pores.
Smoothness too is just such a condition; because,
in the case of rough (unsmooth) bodies, not the
whole of the air will escape from between them
suddenly and violently, but will be witheld (shut
up) in the passages. And rapidity of contact also
is a like condition; for if it come about gently
and slowly, the air would not escape violently.</p>

<p>The echo too will arise from the rebound of
the air escaping from between the two encountering
bodies by reason of its hitting (slapping)
against another hard, flat or hollow body filled
with air, because of the air that is within it
hindering the penetration of the escaped air, and
the latter’s striking the ear [again] after the
first stroke; on the same wise as in the first instance.</p>

<p>As to the Smelling Power; it smells odors
on the sniffing in of air that has received its
odor from an odoriferous body, as one body re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[Pg 56]</span>ceives
its warmth from another warm body. Thus,
if an animal snuffs up air like this into its nose
until such air touches the front of the brain, and
alters it to its own odor, the smelling power
feels it.</p>

<p>As for Taste, it arises only on the coming
to pass of the following change: When the moisture
of the tasting instrument (organ)&mdash;to wit
the tongue&mdash;becomes transformed into the juice
of the newly-come food; and when the mass of
this instrument (organ) has received that juice,
the tasting power will perceive what has happened
within the instrument.</p>

<p>As for Touch: it will only arise upon the
organ’s (instrument’s) receiving the quality of
that which is touched, and upon the touching
power’s perceiving what has been thus presented
(offered) within the organ.</p>

<p>Furthermore, simple sensibles, that are at
once primary and as such the bases of all others,
are in pairs, of which there are eight; and if we
make each into singles, they become sixteen,
to wit:&mdash;</p>

<ol class="alpha">
<li>Touch, four pairs:&mdash;1. heat and cold;
2. moisture and dryness; 3. roughness and smoothness;
4. hardness and softness. The four remaining
senses, each having a pair, viz.,</li>

<li>Smelling, one pair, which is fragrant
odour, and fetid stinking odour,</li>

<li>Tasting, one pair, viz., sweet and bitter,</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[Pg 57]</span>
Hearing, one pair, namely, heavy sound
and sharp sound (or dull and shrill),</li>

<li>(e) Sight, one pair, to wit, white and black.</li>
</ol>
<p>All other sensibles are made up from these
simples, and are intermediates between some two
of them, as for example grey (dusty color) from
white and black, lukewarm from hot and cold.
Moreover all sensibles are felt wholly and solely
through a sort of gathering and sundering, shrinking
and spreading; except sounds, which are
felt only through sundering. Thus:&mdash;</p>

<ol class="no-bottom">
<li>[Warmth is felt through sundering]</li>
<li>Cold is felt through gathering</li>
<li>Moisture, through spreading</li>
<li>Dryness, through shrinking</li>
<li>Roughness, through sundering</li>
<li>Smoothness, through spreading</li>
<li>Hardness, through repelling, which is a sort of gathering and shrinking</li>
<li>Softness, through being repelled, which is not devoid of spreading and sundering</li>
<li>Sweetness, through spreading, devoid of sundering</li>
<li>Bitterness, through sundering and shrinking</li>
<li>Fragrant Odor, through spreading, devoid of sundering</li>
<li>Stinking Odor, through sundering and shrinking</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[Pg 58]</span>Whiteness, through sundering</li>
<li>Blackness, through gathering</li>
</ol>
<p class="add-to-list">[15. and 16. Sounds: one pair, as above under “d.”]</p>

<p>As to the media (intermediaries) between the
feeling powers and the felt forms, they are themselves
devoid of the forms of sensibles; otherwise
it would not be possible for them to be media,
since their own forms&mdash;if they had any&mdash;would
then so engage the apposite power as to divert
it from perceiving any other forms. Such voidness
or freedom from forms is either voidness wholly
and altogether, or else relative voidness through
equableness of the forms in the media, such as
the equable proportion of the qualities touched
in meat, which is a medium between the touching
power and the quality touched, although meat
is incontestably made up of qualities that are
touched, yet notwithstanding this the equableness
of the qualities has annihilated the forms in it.
Examples of the first division&mdash;absolute voidness
and freedom from form&mdash;are the freedom of
air, of water, and of what resembles them among
the various media of sight, from color; the freedom
of air and of water, both which are the two
mediums of smelling, from odor; the freedom of
water, which is the medium of tasting, from
flavor; and the steadiness of the air, which is
the medium of hearing, and its freedom from
motion.</p>

<p>Further, each of these powers, to wit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[Pg 59]</span>
five senses, if actually functionating, perceives
only through coming into relation with the object
felt, nay rather it only perceives at first so much
as has been traced in it of the form of the object
felt. Thus, the eye only perceives that form which
has imprinted itself in it of the object felt; so
also the remainder of the powers (or senses).
Again, in the case of strong wearying sensibles,
such as a loud noise, a strong smell, a shining
and a flashing light, if they are repeated upon
the organ (instrument), spoil and dullen it through
their overworking it. Again, each one of the five
senses perceives, through the means of its own
rightful perception and besides the same, five
other things, to wit: 1. shape; 2. number; 3. size;
4. motion; 5. rest (quiet). That sight, touch, and
taste perceive them, is evident. As to hearing, it
perceives, in accordance (pursuance) with the
variety of the number of sounds, the number of
the sound-emitting objects; and, through the
strength of the sounds, it perceives the size of
the two objects that are hitting against each
other; and, in accordance with a kind of change
and fixedness of the sounds, it perceives motion
and rest; and, in accordance with their volume
around the sound-emitter, be the latter solid or
hollow, it perceives some sorts of shapes. As to
smelling, it knows, in accordance with the change
of directions whence the odors are emitted and
reach it, and through the variety of these odors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[Pg 60]</span>
in their qualities, it knows I say the number of
the things smelt; through the measure of abundance
of the smells, the size of such things;
through the measure of proximity and distance,
changeableness and fixedness, it recognizes their
motion and their rest; and, in accordance with
the sides on which their odor reaches it from
one and the same body, it knows their shape.
Still, these discriminations are very weak in this
power among mankind, owing to the weakness
of the power itself in the human race. [For all
this, men have not the keen scent that many
other animals have, and therefore such discriminations
are in men very weak.]</p>

<h2><a name="SECTION_SEVENTH" id="SECTION_SEVENTH"></a>SECTION SEVENTH</h2>

<p class="chapter-head">Dealing in Detail with the inward Senses, (and
the Motion-Promoting Powers).</p>


<p>I. Not one of the outward senses unites
within itself perception of color, odor, and softness;
and yet, we often come upon a body that
is yellow, and perceive at once so much about
it, namely that it is honey, sweet, nice of smell,
and fluid, although we have neither tasted, nor
smelt, nor even touched it; whence it is manifest
that we possess a power wherein are assembled
the perceptions of the four senses, and have thus
become summed up in it into one single form;
and were it not for this power we should not
know that sweetness, for instance, is other than
blackness, since the discriminator between two
things is he who has known them both. This is
the power which is designated as the common-sense,
and the picturing (or representing) power.
And were it one of the outward apparent senses,
its sway (dominion) would limit itself to the
state of wakefulness only; whereas ocular observation
attests what is quite otherwise; for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[Pg 62]</span>
power does at times perform its action in both
the states of sleep and wakefulness.</p>

<p>II. Furthermore, there is in animals a power
which sets up such forms as have assembled in
the common-sense, discriminates between them,
and differentiates them, without the forms themselves
disappearing from the common-sense. And
this power is undoubtedly other than the aforesaid
picturing power; since in the latter there are
none but true (real) forms that have been acquired
(obtained) from sense; whereas in this power the
case may be otherwise, and it may imagine and
picture wrongly and falsely, and what it had not
received after such a [wrong and false] pattern
(shape) from any one of the senses. This power is
the one named imagination.</p>

<p>Further, there is in animals a power that
passes judgment, upon such or such a thing that
it is so or not so, decisively, and through which
the animal flees away from shunned evil and
seeks chosen good. It is also evident that this
power is other than the imaginative, since this
last imagines (pictures to itself) the sun, in accordance
with what it has got from the apposite
sense, to be of the size of its disc; whereas the
matter stands in this power quite otherwise. So
too the lion finds his prey from far off of the
size of a small bird, yet its form and size in no
way perplex him, but he makes for it. It is also
evident that this power is other than the ima<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[Pg 63]</span>ginative,
and this because the imaginative power
performs its manifold deeds without belief and
conviction on its part that matters are in accordance
with its imagining. This power is what is
named the conjecturing or the surmising faculty
(or judgment).</p>

<p>III. Further, there is in living beings a
power that preserves the purports (or thoughts
and conceptions) of what the senses had perceived,
such as, for instance, that the wolf is an enemy;
the child, a darling next of kin. Wherefore, so
much at least if not more is evident, that this
power is other than the common-sense (or picturing),
inasmuch as in the latter there are no
forms but such as it has gained from the senses;
whereas, again, the senses did not feel the wolf’s
enmity, nor the child’s love, but alone the wolf’s
image, and the child’s bodily shape; and as to
love and fierceness, it is the mind’s eye alone
that has got them, and then stored them up in
this power. It is also clear that this power is
other than the imaginative power, for the reason
that this last does at times imagine what is other
than that which the mind’s eye has deemed
right, found true, and has derived from the
senses; whereas the former power, i.e., the one
here dealt with, imagines none other than what
the mind’s eye has deemed right, has found
true, and has derived from the senses.</p>

<p>This power is also other than the conjecturing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[Pg 64]</span>
(surmising) power, for the reason that this last
does not preserve what some other has deemed
to be true, but it of its own self deems to be
true, whilst the power here treated of does not
itself pass judgment of truth or falsehood, but
only preserves what another has deemed to be
true. This power is called memory, the preserving
or keeping faculty.</p>

<p>Again, the imaginative power is called by
this name&mdash;imagination&mdash;if the conjecturing
(or surmising) power alone use it: and if the
speaking (rational) power use it, it is called the
thinking (cogitative) power.</p>

<p>The heart is the source (spring) of all these
powers (faculties), in Aristotle’s opinion; yet the
sway over them is in different organs (instruments).
Thus the sway over the outward (apparent) senses
is in their known organs; whereas the sway over
the picturing (representing common-sense) power
is in the anterior hollow (ventricle) of the brain;
the sway over the imaginative, in the middle
hollow thereof; the sway over the remembering,
in the posterior hollow thereof; and the sway
over the conjecturing, throughout all the brain,
but above all in the compartment of the imaginative
within the brain [or, throughout the whole
of the brain, but more especially alongside of the
imaginative thereof]. And in so far as these
hollows (ventricles) suffer harm and hurt, so will
the manifold workings of these powers suffer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[Pg 65]</span>
also; for were they, (the powers,) standing independently,
that is to say subsisting in themselves,
and efficient independently, that is to say putting
forth their workings of themselves, they would
not need, for their proper and peculiar actions,
any sort of instrument or organ: in this wise
one recognizes that these powers do not subsist
in themselves, but that the undying power is the
Speaking (Reasoning) Soul, as we shall hereafter
set forth; yet for all this, the soul does maybe
at times seek out for itself after a fashion (so to
speak) the purest quintessences of the kernels of
these powers, and cause them to exist of themselves,
the setting forth of which shall, D.v.,
soon follow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following is the terminology of the five inward
senses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Common-Sense = hiss mushtarak, mutaçawwirah.</li>

<li>Vis formans, imaginatio = khayâl, muçawwirah,
fantasia, takhayyul, mutakhayyilah.</li>

<li>Vis cogitativa, vis imaginativa = mufakkirah,
mutakhayyilah, mutawahhimah, zânnah, mutaçarrifah,
mutafakkirah, takhayyul.</li>

<li>Memory, remembering, preserving = hâfizah,
mutazhakkirah, zhâkirah, zhikr.</li>

<li>Vis existimativa, opinativa = wahm, mutawahhimah,
zhânnah, takhayyul, wahmiyyah.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here follows an attempt to clear up this
bewildering subject:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perception, through any one or more of the
five outward senses, of the outward concrete form.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[Pg 66]</span>
Conception of particular notions, over and
beyond the concrete form perceived.</li>

<li>Memory, which retains both outward forms
perceived as well as recalls inward particular
forms conceived.</li>

<li>Common-Sense, rises a step higher than
the three preceding, in that it unites two or
more of the products of any of the three preceding
and derives from them a new conception.</li>

<li>Opining, which rises higher still and passes
judgment, or comes to a definite opinion as to
the truth or falsehood of conceptions formed.</li>
</ol>

<p>In respect of memory, Ibn Sînâ in his «Kanon»
of Medicine, makes a distinction. He says: «And
just here is a point for scrutiny and judgment
as to whether the preserving power and the
power recalling (to consciousness) such notions
as had been stored up by the opining power
but have passed away from it, are one power
or two.»</p>

<p>Here follows still another attempt:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perception, of the Five Senses, through organs.</li>

<li>Sway of the Common-Sense, in the anterior
hollow.</li>

<li>Sway of the Imaginative Power, in the
middle hollow.</li>

<li>Sway of the Remembering Power, in the
posterior hollow.</li>

<li>Sway of the Conjecturing Power, throughout
all the brain, and alongside of the imaginative
compartment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Number 1. has been dealt with in Section
Six; number 5 belongs exclusively to Man, and
will be further dealt with in the next Section;
the remaining three, to wit numbers 2, 3, and 4,
are in all live animals, and are dealt with in
this Seventh Section. The theory is beautifully
clear and simple: thus, number 2 grasps and
appropriates the outward form brought to it by
the senses; number 3 grasps and appropriates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[Pg 67]</span>
particular conceptions; and number 4 stores
them up; thus also, the one dwelling in the
front hollow is not influenced by the action of
the one occupying the middle or the hindermost
hollow, whereas conversely each succeeding faculty
has recourse to the one preceding it in
order of place. This theory arose after an acquaintance
with the division and arrangement of
the brain into chambers had made considerable
progress with the Arabs.</p>

<h2><a name="SECTION_EIGHTH" id="SECTION_EIGHTH"></a>SECTION EIGHTH</h2>

<p class="chapter-head">A Sketch of the Human Soul from the Starting-Point
whence it sets out until the End-Point
whither it reaches its Perfection.</p>


<p>No doubt that the speaking (rational) species
of the [genus] animal is distinguished from the
non-speaking (irrational species) by a power,
through which it is enabled to imagine things
rational, which power is called the speaking (rational)
soul; and the custom has obtained of
calling it the “hylik” mind, that is to say the
potential mind, thus likening it to the hyle,
which is potential matter.<a name="FNanchor_J_24" id="FNanchor_J_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_24" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> Moreover this power
is found in the whole human species; and it
possesses in itself at the outset none of the mentally-grasped
forms, but these arise within it
after two sorts of processes: The first is through
a Divine guidance, without effort of study, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[Pg 70]</span>
without profitting from the senses, as for example
the mentally-grasped self-evident axioms, like
our conviction that the whole is greater than the
part, and that two contradictories (contrasts) do
not come together at one time in one and the
same thing; so that sane-minded adults share
equally in the acquisition of such forms. The
second sort of process is through earning [the
mental thought or truth] by reasoning process, and
by array of proof and demonstration, such as the
conception of logical truths, like genera, species,
differentia, and properties, simple terms, and
terms compounded in the various modes of compositions
[of several ideas into one composite
term], justly-moded syllogisms both valid and
false, propositions which if moded into syllogisms
lead to necessary demonstrated results, or to argumentative
probable results, or to equally balanced
rhetorical results, or to primary (axiomatical)
sophistical results, or to impossible poetical
results;<a name="FNanchor_15_25" id="FNanchor_15_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_25" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and such mentally-grasped forms as
the recognition of the certainty of natural realities,
like hyle (primitive matter) and form, privation
(non-existence) and Nature, place and
time, rest and motion, bulky bodies of the sky-firmament
and bulky elemental bodies, absolute
universal being and absolute nothingness, generation
absolute and corruption absolute, origen
of things generated that are within the sky, that
are within the deepest depths of mines, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[Pg 71]</span>
are on the earth’s crust, amongst which last-named
are plant and animal, the true conception
“Man” and the truth of the soul’s conception of
its own self; and still further such mentally-grasped
forms as the conception of ideas mathematical,
amongst which are number, pure geometry,
stellar geometry, harmonical or musical
geometry, optical geometry; and again, further
still, such ideas as the conception of divine affairs,
like the knowledge of the principles of the
absolute self-existent in so far as he exists <i>per
se</i>, and of the principles consequently adhering
to him, such as potentiality, power and efficiency,
first cause and accounting cause, essence and accidens,
genus and species, incompatibility and
homogeneity, agreement and disagreement, unity
and multiplicity; and, still further, the fixing of
the principles of the speculative (theoretical)
sciences, amongst which are the mathematical,
the natural and the logical&mdash;all which cannot
be attained save through this latter science;<a name="FNanchor_16_26" id="FNanchor_16_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_26" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
and still further, such as proving the first Creator
and the first Created, the universal (generic) soul
and <i>how</i> creation came about, the relative position
of mind towards creation, and the relative
position of soul towards mind, the relative position
of hyle towards nature, and of forms towards
the soul, the relative position of the skies, orbs,
planets and all existing things towards hyle and
towards form, and why and wherefore they differ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[Pg 72]</span>
so widely as they do as to forwards and backwards
([Greek: proteron kai hysteron: προτερον και ὑστερον]) of development; and the
knowledge of the divine government, universal
nature, primal providence, prophetic inspiration,
the divine holy spirit, sublime angels, attaining
to the certainty <span class="correction" title="In the original book: ef">of</span> the Creator’s being beyond
all partnership and similitude [i.e. recognizing
the truth that polytheism and anthropomorphism,
are to be rejected]; and attaining to the knowledge
of what rewards await the righteous, and what
punishments impend the wicked, of the delight
and the pain overtaking souls after their abandoning
the bodies.</p>

<p>Further, this power which conceives these
ideas does at times gain from sense forms mental,
imaginative, and innate in (instinctive to) itself;
and in such a case it does this in that it lays
before itself the forms that are in the conceiving
power and in the remembering (preserving) power,
by employing the imaginative and the conjecturing
power, and then contemplates them, and finds
them to have participated in some forms and to
have differed in some other forms; and finds some
amongst the forms that are in these powers to
be essential, and others to be accidental. And
as to their participation in forms, it is like the
participation of the form Richard and an ass, in
the conceiver’s mind, in the idea of Life; and
the differing of the two in the idea of speaking
(rational), and non-speaking (brute). As to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[Pg 73]</span>
essential form, it is e.g. like the life that is in
them both; as for the accidental, it is e.g. like
their blackness and whiteness. So that if we find
the two aforesaid on this wise&mdash;i.e., as stated,&mdash;[the
mind] makes each one of these essential
and accidental, participated and peculiar forms,
one universal mental form singly and alone, and
thus through this working-over process, it gets
at mental genera, species, differentia, properties,
accidens; then it combines these single notions
into particular combinations; then into syllogistic
argumentative combinations and deduces from
them corollaries from the results&mdash;all which it
gets through the service of the animal powers,
with the help of universal mind, after the manner
that we shall set forth later on, and through
the intermediary of such necessary self-evident
mental axioms as it has been endowed with.</p>

<p>Moreover this power, although it derives help
from the sensuous power when getting out single
mental forms from the sensuous forms, yet it
does not need the sensuous power for conceiving
these ideas (notions) within itself and for setting
up syllogisms out of them, neither when affirming,
nor when conceiving the two dicta [of abstraction
&amp; generalization], as we shall afterwards
explain. And to whatever extent it derives sensuous
corollaries, for which there shall be need,
through the said working-over process, yet it
dispenses with the employment of the sensuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[Pg 74]</span>
powers, nay it is even sufficient for and in itself,
for the carrying on of all its manifold activities.
And just as the sensuous powers perceive solely
and wholly through an assimilation of that which
is felt, so also do the mental powers perceive
solely through and wholly through an assimilation
of the mentally-grasped; and this assimilation
is the abstraction of the form from matter, and
the adhering to it; only that the feeling power
does not get the sensuous form through willed
motion and voluntary action on its part, but
through the arrival of the very thing felt unto
it, either by chance or through the intermediary
of the motion-promoting power, and laying bare
of the forms unto it (abstraction) through the
help of the media that connect the forms with
it; whereas, in the case of the mental power,
(Reason Understanding) this process is otherwise;
for by and through itself it at times does itself
perform the abstraction (laying bare) of the form
from matter as often as it wills, and then clings
unto it. And for this reason it is said that the
sentient power is more or less passive in its conception
[or, that the feeling power is after a
fashion acted upon when it conceives], and that
the mental (understanding) power is active; nay
rather it is said, for this reason, that the sentient
power cannot do without instruments (organs),
and has in itself no efficiency; and how is it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[Pg 75]</span>
possible to apply such a statement (proposition)
to the mental (understanding) power?</p>

<p>The mind (Understanding, Reason) is in fact
and deed wholly and solely nothing else than the
forms of mentally-grasped things, if these be
arrayed in the very mind potentially, and through
it they are brought out to effective action; and
hence it is said that the mind is in fact and
deed at once both understanding and understood.
Amongst the properties of the understanding
power is this, that it unifies the many and multiplies
the one through analysis and synthesis. As
to multiplication, it is such as the analysis of
one man into essence, body, nourishment-getting,
animal, speaking (rational). As to unification of
the many, it is such as the composition (synthesis)
of this one man out of essence, body, animal,
speaking (rational) into one notion which is
mankind (human being).</p>

<p>Moreover the mind, although it applies its
activity within a duration of time in arranging
syllogisms, through using reflection, yet the result
itself, which this reflection obtains, and which is
the fruit of thought and the end sought after, is
not dependant upon time, nor is it obtained save
at an instant; nay more than this, the mind
itself is wholly above and beyond all time.</p>

<p>And the reasoning (speaking) soul, if it
engages itself upon the sciences, its activity is
called mind or intellect, and it is accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[Pg 76]</span>
called speculative or theoretical mind: which I
have already described. And if it engages itself
upon overcoming blameworthy powers, that entice
unto wrongdoing through their excess, unto folly
through their <span class="correction" title="In the original book: abandonnment">abandonment</span>, unto impetuosity
through their agitation, unto cowardice through
their indifference or lukewarmness, or unto wickedness
through their excitement, or unto degeneration
through their smouldering, and leads them
over into the paths of wisdom, endurance, chastity&mdash;in
short unto righteousness, then its activity
is called ruling or governing, and it is accordingly
called practical mind or reason. Again, the reasoning
(speaking) power is sometimes so fitted out
in a few persons through<a name="FNanchor_K_27" id="FNanchor_K_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_27" class="fnanchor">[K]</a>vigils and conjunction
with the universal mind as to be quite independent
of taking refuge unto syllogistic argument
and reflection, but rather is sufficiently stored
with inspiration and revelation to render it wholly
absolved from such ordinary means as mental
ratiocination: this peculiar property of the reasoning
mind is called hallowedness or sanctity,
and it is accordingly called Holy Ghost. Unto
such a favoured rank and degree none shall attain
save prophets and apostles, upon whom be peace
and blessing.</p>

<h2><a name="SECTION_NINTH" id="SECTION_NINTH"></a>SECTION NINTH</h2>


<p class="chapter-head">in which
the Proofs of the Essentiality of the Soul, and
of Its Independence of Body in its Structure,
are set forth in pursuance of the Method
of Logicians.</p>

<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline"><a name="SUB-SECTION_9-A" id="SUB-SECTION_9-A"></a>SUB-SECTION A:</h3>&mdash;One of the logical proofs
for establishing this Claim:</div>

<p>Let us however first preface it with premisses,
among which are:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First Premiss</i>: that man conceives universal
(generic) notions wherein a greater or less multitude
participates, such as man at large, and
animal at large. And of these generic notions
there are such as he conceives through a particular
[or partial, or an obligatory] synthesis, and
there are such others of these generic notions as
he does not conceive by any synthesis, but singly
and individually. And unless he shall have conceived
the latter division (class, sett), it is not
possible for him to conceive the former. Further,
he conceives each one of these generic universal
notions only under <i>one</i> form, wholly stripped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[Pg 80]</span>
(abstracted) from all relationship to its concrete
sensuous particulars, since the particulars of each
one of the generic notions are potentially endless
[in variety and number] and no one of the particulars
has any right of priority over another
particular in respect of that <i>one</i> form of the
generic notion.</p>

<p><i>Second Premiss</i>: that a form, whatsoever
body it detaches, reduces, and adorns, and in
general whatsoever individual of divisible things
it so takes hold of, it clothes the same and exactly
fits the same in every one of its parts. And
whatsoever clothes and exactly fits a divisible
thing in all its parts is itself divisible; and hence
every form that has clothed and exactly fitted
any body whatsoever is itself divisible.</p>

<p><i>Third Premiss</i>: that in every generic (universal)
form, if regard be had, in the division of
such form, purely and simply to its abstract self,
then it will not at all validly follow that the
parts into which it has been divided shall necessarily
resemble the whole in its complete notion;
otherwise it must follow that the generic form,
whose division has been made in respect of its
abstract self, has not been itself divided, but
that it has been divided into its constituents,
whether these be its various species or its numerous
individuals, whereas multiplicity of species
or of individuals does not necessarily entail division
in the abstract generic notion itself. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[Pg 81]</span>
it has been laid down as a fact that such division
has actually taken place, which is a contradiction.
Hence our assertion that the parts of the generic
form do not resemble it in its full and complete
notion is a true dictum.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Premiss</i>: that in the mental form,
if regard be had to its division, it will not
validly follow that its parts are denuded (stripped)
of the totality of its notion. This is so because,
if we admit such total denudation, and assert
that these parts are utterly aloof from the complete
conception of the generic whole, then the
form will arise, in such parts, only upon their
assembling together, so that they are in fact
things devoid of that form which will arise in
them on their being set together, which is a
quality of the parts of materia capax or passive
matter which occupies space ([Greek: dektikon: δεκτικον]); [Note: The
recipient is the acted upon, and it is called
matter, and also place.]; and hence the division
has not been effected in the generic form, but in
its objective concrete materials. But it has been
asserted that the division has come to pass in it:
this too is a contradiction. Therefore our assertion:
“It will not validly follow that its parts are
stripped of the totality of its notion” is a true
statement.</p>

<p><i>Fifth Premiss</i>: which is the result of the
two preceding: that in the generic form, if it be
possible that divisibility be considered in it, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[Pg 82]</span>
its parts are neither wholly devoid of the perfect
form nor are completely exhaustive of it, and
are as it were [component, constituent] parts of
its definition and outline (or description).</p>

<p>Given then these premisses, we shall further
unquestionably say that a mentally-grasped
form&mdash;in short all knowledge&mdash;claims some
abode somewhere, which abode is both an essence
itself and a part of man’s self, so that such essence
will not be devoid of being either a divisible
(material) body or a non-corporeal indivisible
essence. I however say, that it is not licit
that it be a corporeal body; because a generic
mentally-grasped form, if it abide in a body,
then it is inevitably possible for divisibility to
befall it, as we have shown above. Nor is it licit
that its parts be otherwise than resembling the
whole from one standpoint, and contrasting
with it from another standpoint, in a word
each one of the parts contains somewhat of the
notion of the whole; whereas there is no generic
form whatsoever but of whose parts a compound
can be formed that is partly like it and
partly unlike it save genera and differentia; consequently
these parts are genera and differentia,
and hence each one of them is in its turn a generic
form; and thus the same assertion repeats itself
as above.</p>

<p>Inevitably this will end in a form that is
no longer divisible into genera and differentia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[Pg 83]</span>
owing to the impracticability of progression ad
infinitum into parts differing in notions, even if
it be established that corporeal bodies are so
divided into parts ad infinitum.</p>

<p>Moreover it is well-known that the generic
(universal) form, concerning which it is held that
it is divisible only into genera and differentia, if
there be nevertheless some of these two that is
not divisible into genera and differentia, then
<i>this some</i> will be in itself utterly indivisible in
every sense and respect; and consequently what
is compounded, of these two of that <i>some</i>, will
also be indivisible, seeing that it is well-known,
for example, that <i>man</i> cannot be conceived except
along with the two conceptions <i>living</i> and <i>rational</i>
(<i>speaking</i>). In short, it is not possible to conceive
a generic universal form that has genus and differens
save by conceiving them all together.
Therefore, the form which we have described as
having taken up its abode in the body has not
taken up its abode therein, which is a contradiction,
and therefore the diametrically contrary to
it is true, namely our assertion that a generic
(universal) mental form does not abide in any
corporeal body whatsoever; and consequently the
essence in which a generic mental form abides is
a spiritual essence, not qualified with the qualities
of bodies, which is what we call the Rational
Speaking Soul. And this is what we set out
to show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[Pg 84]</span></p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline"><a name="SUB-SECTION_9-B" id="SUB-SECTION_9-B"></a>SUB-SECTION B:</h3>&mdash;A second of the proofs,
which corroborate this claim and confirm (correct)
it, is what I am now going to set forth. I say
then that body of and through itself does not
effect conception of mentally-grasped things, since
all bodies have in common that they are body,
and differ amongst each other in capacity for
conceiving mentally-grasped things. Wherefore
living (animal) bodies are qualified to conceive
mentally-grasped things only by and through
certain powers that are put within them. And
if these powers conceive by and through themselves,
without the cooperation of the body, it
follows that they are in themselves fit and apt
to be an abode for mental forms. And what is
thus qualified is itself an essence; consequently
if such conception is occurring, they, namely
these powers, are essences. Now, it is clear that
this power conceives mentally-grasped things by
and through itself only, and not at all through
cooperation of body; for, we contend, concerning
whatsoever perceives any thing through cooperation
of body, that the oftener wearying perceptibles
are repeated upon it the more do they
tend towards ruining and spoiling it and producing
dullness and exhaustion in it, it being nothing
but a frail instrument and organ whose strength
has been reduced, owing to the over-tasking
imposed upon it on the power’s employing it;
and for this cause the seeing power, for example,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[Pg 85]</span>
gets weaker the oftener it persists in looking at
the sun’s shape. So too the hearing power, if
loud sounds reach it repeatedly.</div>

<p>Whereas this power, to wit the one that
conceives mentally-grasped things, the more it
perceives wearying mental conceptions the stronger
it becomes for its work [the more efficient it
becomes], wherefore it has no need for an instrument
in its operation of perceiving, and hence it
perceives of itself. Now, we have already shown
that every power perceiving of its own self is
an essence; so then this power is an essence,
which is what we set out to show.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline"><a name="SUB-SECTION_9-C" id="SUB-SECTION_9-C"></a>SUB-SECTION C:</h3>&mdash;Among the proofs that
guide to this claim is what I shall now show, so
I say as follows.</div>

<p>The indwelling (immanence) of form in body
is at once both passive and receptive&mdash;passivity
of the form and receptivity of the body. And
whereas one and the same thing excludes the
possibility of its being both doer and done, it
becomes clear unto us that a body is not able of
itself to dress itself in one mentally-grasped
form and strip off another. Yet nevertheless we
see a man consciously and with forethought conceiving
and proceeding from one mentally-grasped
form unto another, which operation is not devoid
of being either an act peculiar to body, or else
an act peculiar to the rational speaking power,
or finally an act commonly shared between them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[Pg 86]</span>
both. It has been already shown [perhaps he here
refers to the Second Section of this Essay] that
it is not licit to attribute action and doing peculiarly
and specially to body; nay I will say and
not even to body conjointly with the rational
power; since body is a co-adjutor of that power,
helping towards affording an abode for any form
whatsoever in that body’s own self, seeing that
it has become known to us that body along with
the power will both become fit subjects for this
form that has thus arisen; a subject however is
to be stigmatized with nothing beyond simple
passivity alone, whereas both these two are [aggressive]
acts and deeds. Consequently this is an
act peculiar to the power. And everything that, in
its act which emanates from its own self, has had
no need for another thing to help it, will not
need in its own structure anything beyond its
own self to help it, seeing that independence or
isolation in the structure of self precedes independence
or isolation in the putting forth of self-emanating
action. Therefore this power is an
essence standing of itself [independent of body];
and consequently the rational soul is an essence.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline"><a name="SUB-SECTION_9-D" id="SUB-SECTION_9-D"></a>SUB-SECTION D:</h3>&mdash;Among the proofs that
guide (point) to the validity of this <span class="correction" title="In the original book: contension">contention</span> is
what I am now going to say.</div>

<p>No doubt a live body and live organs or
instruments, if they accomplish their growing age
and the age of standstill, begin to wither and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[Pg 87]</span>
diminish, to lose power and waste away, which
[in human beings] is on passing forty years. Now,
were the rational reasoning power a corporeal
organic power, then there would be found not one
single individual of mankind at these years of
his age but what this power of his would have
begun to diminish. But the case in most people
is quite otherwise, nay indeed it is usual amongst
the majority that as to intellectual power they
improve in cleverness and increase in insight.
Hence the structure of the rational power is not
upheld by the body nor by the organ; and hence
this power is an essence standing of itself, which
is what we wished to show.</p>


<div class="section-start"><h3 class="h3inline"><a name="SUB-SECTION_9-E" id="SUB-SECTION_9-E"></a>SUB-SECTION E:</h3>&mdash;Among the proofs for the
validity of this <span class="correction" title="In the original book: contension">contention</span> is the following also.</div>

<p>So much at least is clear, namely that not
one of the bodily powers has the strength for
performing infinite multifarious actions; and this
is so because the strength of the one half of such
a body will inevitably be found to be weaker
than the strength of the whole; and the weaker
is less powerful to perform and overcome than
the stronger; and whatsoever, other than the
infinite, gets less is itself finite; hence the strength
of each one of the two halves is finite; hence too
their sum is finite, since that the sum of two
finites is itself finite, whereas it has been contended
that it is infinite, which is a contradiction.
Hence the sound view is that the powers of bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[Pg 88]</span>
are not powerful enough to perform infinite
manifold deeds. The rational power however is
powerful enough to perform many infinite deeds,
seeing that forms geometrical, arithmetical, and
philosophical, which the rational power has to
perform among other of its acts, are infinite.
Therefore the rational power is not standing by
and through the body, and hence therefore it
stands of itself and is an essence of itself.</p>

<p>Further, so much at least is clear that the
corruption of one of two conjoined essences does
not entail and enjoin the corruption of the other:
wherefore the death of the body does not render
obligatory the death of the soul, which is what
we wanted to show.</p>

<h2><a name="SECTION_TENTH" id="SECTION_TENTH"></a>SECTION TENTH</h2>

<p class="chapter-head">To Establish that there is a Mental Essence,
Distinct from Bodies, which stands towards
Human Souls in the stead of Light toward
Sight, and in the stead of a Source or Fountain;
and To Establish that Souls, if they
leave the Bodies, unite therewith.</p>


<p>As to the mental essence, we find it in infants
devoid of every mental form. Then, later
on in life, we find in it self-evident axiomatic
mentally-grasped notions, without effort of learning
and without reflection. So that the arising of
them within it will not fail of being either
through sense and experience, or else through
divine outpouring reaching to it. But it is not
licit to hold that the arising of such primary
mental form will be through experience, seeing
that experience does not afford and supply a
necessary and inevitable judgment, since experience
does not go so far as to believe or disbelieve
definitively the existence of something different
to the judgment drawn from what it has perceived.
Indeed experience, although it shows us that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[Pg 90]</span>
every animal we perceive moves on chewing the
lower jaw, yet it does not supply us with a convincing
judgment that such is the case with every
animal; for were this true, it would not be licit
for the crocodile to exist which moves his upper
jaw on chewing. Therefore not every judgment
we have arrived at, as to things, through our
sensuous perception, is applicable to and holds
good of all that we have perceived or have not
perceived of such things, but it may so be that
what we have not perceived differ from what we
have perceived. Whereas our conception that a
whole is greater than a part is not [formed]
because we have sensuously felt every part and
every whole that are so related, seeing that even
such an experience will not <span class="correction" title="In the original book: garanty">guaranty</span> to us that
there will be no whole and no part differently
related.</p>

<p>Likewise the dictum concerning the impossibility
of two opposites (contrasts) coming together
in one and the same thing, and that things which
are equal to one and the same thing are equal
to one another. And likewise the dictum concerning
our holding proofs to be true if they be
valid, for the belief in and conviction of their
validity does not become valid by and through
learning and effort of study; else this would
draw out ad infinitum [inasmuch as each proof
rests upon given presuppositions, whose validity
would in its turn have to be proved]. Nor is this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[Pg 91]</span>
gained from sense, for the reason that we have
mentioned. Consequently both the latter as well
as the former [certainty] are gained from a godly
outflow reaching unto the rational soul, and the
rational soul reaching unto it; so that this mental
form arises therein. Also, as to this outflow,
unless it have in its own self such a generic
(universal) mental form, it would not be able
to engrave it within the rational soul. Hence such
form is in the outflow’s own self. And whatsoever
Self has in it a mental form is an essence, other
than a body, and not within a body, and standing
of itself. Therefore this outflow unto which the
soul reaches is a mental essence, not a body, not
in a body, standing of itself, and one which stands
towards the rational soul in the stead of light to
sight; yet however with this difference, namely
that light supplies unto sight the power of perceiving
only, and not the perceived form, whereas
this essence supplies, exclusively by and through
its sole and single self, unto the rational power,
the power of perceiving, and brings about therein
the perceived forms also, as we have set forth above.</p>

<p>Now, if the rational soul’s conceiving rational
forms be a source of completion and perfection
for it, and be effected and brought about on
reaching unto this essence, and if worldly earthly
labors, such as its thought, its sorrows and joy,
its longings, hamper the power and withold it
from reaching thereunto, so that it will not reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[Pg 92]</span>
thereunto save only through abandoning these
powers and getting rid of them, there being
nothing to stop it from continued Reaching save
the living body,&mdash;then consequently if it quit
the body it will not cease to be reaching unto
its Perfector and attached to Him.</p>

<p>Again, what reaches unto its Perfector and
attaches itself to Him is safe against corruption,
all the more so if even during disconnection from
Him it has not undergone corruption. Wherefore
the soul after death shall ever remain and continue
unwavering [and undying] and attached to this
noble essence, which is called generic universal
mind, and in the language of the lawgivers the
Divine Knowledge.</p>

<p>As to the other powers, such as the animal
and the vegetable: Whereas every one of them
performs its proper peculiar action only by and
through the live body, and in no other way, consequently
they will never quit live bodies, but
will die with their death, seeing that every thing
which is, and yet has no action, is idle and
useless. Yet nevertheless the rational soul does
gain, by its connection with them, from them
their choicest and purest lye and wash, and
leaves for death the husks. And were it not so,
the rational soul would not use them in consciousness.
Wherefore the rational soul shall
surely depart (migrate, travel) taking along the
kernels of the other powers after death ensues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>We have thus made a clear statement concerning
souls, and got at which souls are [ever]lasting,
and which of them will not be fitted out
and armed with [ever]lastingness. It still remains
for us, in connection with this research, to show
how a soul exists within live bodies, and the aim
and end for which it is found within the same,
and what measure will be bestowed upon it, in
the hereafter, of eternal delight and perpetual
punishment, and of [temporary] punishment that
ceases after a duration of time that shall ensue
upon the decease of the live body; and to treat
of the notion that is designated by the lawgivers
as intercession (mediation), and of the quality
(attribute) of the four angels and the throne-bearers.
Were it not however that the custom
prevails to isolate such research from the research
whose path we have been treading, out of high
esteem and reverence for it, and to make the
latter research precede in order of treatment the
former, to the end of levelling the road and
paving it solidly, I should (would) have followed
up these [ten] sections with a full and complete
treatment of the subject dealt with in them.
Notwithstanding all this, were it not for fear of
wearying by prolixity, I would have disregarded
the demands of custom herein. Thus then whatever
it may please the Prince&mdash;God prolong
his highness&mdash;to command as to treating singly
of such notions, I shall put forth, in humble com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[Pg 94]</span>pliance
and obedience, my utmost effort, God
Almighty willing; and may wisdom never cease
to revive through him after fainting, to flourish
after withering, so that its sway may be renewed
through his sway, and through his days its days
may come back again, and that through his
prestige the prestige of its devotees be exalted,
and the seekers after its favor abound, so God
almighty will.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
